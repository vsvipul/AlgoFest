# AlgoFest
A repository for Hacktoberfest contributions. Just add any algorithm in whatever language you want to.

## Guidelines
- Add yourself to Contributors.md following the format of already inserted entries in it.
- Please follow Title Case while naming your files. (eg: InserionSort.cpp)
- Code files should go into a directory with the same name as the language they were coded in (ex: Python/InsertionSort.py)
- If somebody added an algo in a language you wanted to do, don't worry! Just add a number to the end of the filename and we'll add it ! (ex: InsertionSort3.cpp)
-add some practice questions
Other than that, just have fun! Happy Hacktoberfest!
